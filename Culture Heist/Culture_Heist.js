In remembrance, Mexico has made numerous requests to retrieve a princess Aztec headdress from the United States, however they have been ignored and ridiculed. The United States denies Mexico’s request to reclaim their cultural heritage on the basis that the ancient relic is at risk of being damaged during transport. Thus, disallowing the request of reclamation to be fulfilled. As a valuable piece of the nation’s history, it is unclear as to how the ancient relic made its way thousands of miles to the mainland United States. And despite lawsuits having been underway for decades to reclaim the elaborate feather headdress believed to have been worn by an Aztec Emperor, Mexico continues to insist on bringing back the artifact to no avail. The United States has made the artifact into a major tourist attraction for the museum and continues to reappropriate the relic for its own gains.","\n","^It is our job to help right the historical wrongs enacted by colonizers. The pillaging of artifacts must stop because it has been long overdue for material cultural heritage to be returned to its rightful and original owners. Museums will not listen to the pleas of the people to have them return archaeological artifacts, and the calls to restore cultural property to places of origin are constantly being ignored. These institutions and structures of power are steeped in historical colonial practice and old money. While some items end up in museum collections for reasons other than looting and theft, the Aztec artifact is a piece considered one of the most important historical relics in Mexico and its several requests for its return have been unsuccessful. The museum professionals are not “better qualified” to care for the artifact. These professionals making these judgements are white European men who cannot or will not acknowledge that disputes over cultural property are part of the decolonization of museums. They have been benefitting from a colonial past and it is due time to take ownership of their histories and return what is not theirs to its rightful owners. Whether it is voluntarily or involuntarily.","\n","^That is where we come in. We need to take matters into our own hands. Mexican cultural heritage can no longer remain a prisoner of Western museums. These people have no right or claim to our cultural property. Yet, they continue to lock up our legacy and claim an entitlement to keep it despite knowing it was taken by colonial armies through what would now be considered as crimes against humanity.”","\n","^\"So, here is the plan.\"","\n","^The leader tapped on the map of the museum.","\n","^\"We are going to steal the Aztec artifact.
